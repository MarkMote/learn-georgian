"identity_state","stage_foundations_01","The Identity Scene","[Subject] + [Noun/Adj] + [Verb]","Used to describe who you are, what you are, or how you are.","In Georgian, the word for 'am/is/are' changes its ending to match the person. At the start of the sentence, the person or thing you are talking about is in its simplest 'dictionary' form. In grammar, we call this the **Nominative Case**. The changes to the verb tail are called **Conjugations**. In the third person (he/she/it), the verb არის is often shortened to just a single ა sound at the end of the noun."
"location_state","stage_foundations_01","The Location Scene","[Subject] + [Place]-ში + [Verb]","Used to say where someone or something is located.","To say 'in' or 'at' a place, you don't use a separate word. Instead, you glue the ending -ში directly onto the place name. Because these markers go after the word rather than before it, they are called **Postpositions** (unlike English 'pre-positions'). The subject is still in its simplest dictionary form, the **Nominative Case**, and the verb is the same 'to be' verb used for identity."
"desire_present","stage_experiencer_02","The Desire Scene","[Person]-ს + [Thing] + [Verb]","Used to express wanting an object or a situation.","Georgian treats 'wanting' differently than English. Instead of 'I want coffee,' the logic is more like 'Coffee is wanted to me.' Because of this, the person who wants something gets a special -ს ending. The thing they want stays in its base form. Linguists call this **Inversion** because the grammar is 'flipped.' The person wanting is the receiver (**Dative Case**), while the thing being wanted is the actual subject."
"possession_inanimate","stage_experiencer_02","The Possession Scene (Objects)","[Person]-ს + [Thing/Nom] + [Verb]","Used to say you 'have' an object or an abstract thing.","'Having' is an experience. The owner gets the -ს tail (Dative). Uniquely, the thing you have stays in the simplest base form (**Nominative Case**), not the object form. This is the **Inversion** pattern: the owner is the receiver, and the object is the grammatical subject."
"motion_away_present","stage_motion_04","The Away-Motion Scene","[Subject] + [Place]-ში + [Verb]","Used to describe moving from here to a destination.","When you move toward a goal, the verb uses a special 'GPS' prefix მი- which means 'away from the speaker.' The place you are going to gets the -ში (in) or -ზე (on) ending. In Georgian, the verb for 'going' tracks both direction and the fact that you are currently in the process of moving. The subject is in its base form, the **Nominative Case**."
"origin_state","stage_foundations_01","The Origin Scene","[Subject] + [Place]-დან + [Verb]","Used to say where you or others are from.","To say 'from,' Georgian glues the ending -დან to the place name. This is another **Postposition**. In Georgian, many city names end in the letter ი, which usually drops before you add the 'from' ending (e.g., თბილისი becomes თბილისიდან). The subject remains in its simplest base form."
"liking_present","stage_experiencer_02","The Liking Scene","[Person]-ს + [Thing] + [Verb]","Used to express that you like a person, place, or thing.","Similar to wanting, 'liking' is something that happens to you. The logic is 'This thing is pleasing to me.' Because of this, the person doing the liking gets the -ს ending and is the receiver of the feeling (**Dative Case**). The thing being liked is the actual subject. If you like a person, the grammar stays exactly the same—the person you like is simply the base word."
"necessity_present","stage_experiencer_02","The Necessity Scene","[Person]-ს + [Thing] + [Verb]","Used for physical needs or things that are required.","Georgian distinguishes between 'wanting' (desire) and 'needing' (necessity). The grammar is the same 'flipped' pattern used for feelings: the person who needs something is the receiver (**Dative Case**, marked with -ს), and the required object is the subject. It helps to think of this as 'X is a necessity to me.'"
"doing_present","stage_active_present_03","The Action Scene","[Subject] + [Object]-ს + [Verb]","Used for actions done to an object, like making coffee or doing work.","In the present tense, when you do something to an object, that object gets the -ს ending. This marks it as the receiver of the action. The person doing the action is in their simplest base form. This is the standard way to describe an ongoing action where a person acts directly upon an external thing."
"activity_present","stage_active_present_03","The Activity Scene","[Subject] + [Verb]","Used for general activities that don't need an object, like working or talking.","Some verbs describe an ongoing process or activity rather than an action on a specific thing (e.g., 'I am working' vs 'I am building a house'). In Georgian, these are called **Medial Verbs**. They almost always use the base form for the subject in the present tense. These verbs often end in -ობ or -ებ."
"motion_toward_present","stage_motion_04","The Toward-Motion Scene","[Subject] + [Goal]-ში + [Verb]","Used when someone is moving toward the speaker (Coming).","In Georgian, direction is built into the start of the verb. While 'away' motion uses the prefix მი-, 'toward' motion uses the prefix მო-. This acts like a 'GPS' for the listener to know if someone is arriving. The subject remains in the simplest base form, and the destination still takes an ending like -ში."
"possession_animate","stage_possession_05","The Possession Scene (Living Beings)","[Person]-ს + [Being] + [Verb]","Used to say you 'have' a person (family, friends) or a pet/animal.","Georgian makes a fundamental distinction between 'having' an object and 'having' a living, breathing being. For people and animals, you use the verb მყავს instead of მაქვს. This distinction is called **Animacy**. Just like the object possession frame, this is a 'flipped' grammar where the owner is the receiver (marked with -ს) and the person 'possessed' is the actual subject."
"ability_present","stage_experiencer_02","The Ability Scene","[Person]-ს + [Action] + [Verb]","Used to say what you 'can' or are 'able' to do.","In Georgian, 'can' is not an action you perform; it is a possibility that exists for you. Because of this, it follows the 'flipped' pattern where the person is the receiver. The person who has the ability gets the -ს ending. The action or thing they can do is the actual subject. The verb შემიძლია literally translates to 'it is possible for me.'"
"preference_present","stage_experiencer_02","The Preference Scene","[Person]-ს + [Thing] + [Verb]","Used to express a preference or to say you 'prefer' one thing over another.","To 'prefer' something follows the same internal logic as wanting or liking. The thing preferred is seen as being 'better' to the person. This is another 'flipped' frame where the person is the receiver (marked with -ს) and the thing they prefer is in its base form. The verb მირჩევნია anchors this 'Internal Choice' scene."
"knowledge_present","stage_active_present_03","The Knowledge Scene","[Subject]-მა + [Fact] + [Verb]","Used to say that you know a fact or a piece of information.","The verb 'to know' (codna) is irregular. In the present tense, the 3rd person subject (he/she) takes the **Ergative Case** (-მა) instead of the base form. For example: 'Kacma icis' (The man knows). The fact being known is the object."
"intent_optative_present","stage_intent_07","The 'Let's' Scene","[Subject] + [Verb]","Used for suggestions (Let's go!), intentions, or asking 'Should I?'","When you are not just stating a fact but suggesting a goal or a possibility, the verb changes its ending to a 'request' form. This is called the **Optative Mood**. We use this for 'Let's drink coffee' or 'Should I come?'. It is the foundation for expressing purpose and social suggestions."
"obligation_intransitive","stage_intent_07","The Obligation Scene (Motion/State)","[Subject/Nom] + [Verb] + უნდა","Used for 'Must Go', 'Must Be' (Intransitive).","To say someone 'must' go or stay, use 'unda'. For motion and state verbs, the subject stays in the simplest **Nominative Case**. Example: 'Kaci (Nom) unda cavides'. Distinguish this from 'Must Do' which requires Ergative."
"obligation_active","stage_intent_07","The Obligation Scene (Action)","[Subject]-მა + [Object] + [Verb] + უნდა","Used for 'Must Do/Make'.","When 'must' is used with an action verb, the subject takes the **-მა** ending, similar to the Past Tense."
"emotion_experiencer_present","stage_experiencer_02","The Emotion Scene","[Person]-ს + [Verb]","Used for internal feelings like joy, fear, or worry.","Feelings in Georgian are not things you 'do'; they are things that 'happen to you.' Because of this, emotions follow the 'Experiencer' pattern where you are the receiver of the feeling. The person feeling the emotion takes the -ს ending. For example, to say 'I am afraid,' the logic is 'Fear is to me' (მეშინია)."
"perception_experiencer_present","stage_experiencer_02","The Understanding Scene","[Person]-ს + [Thing] + [Verb]","Used for understanding, hearing, or perceiving information.","In Georgian, understanding is treated as a sense that 'reaches' you, similar to hearing. This follows the 'Experiencer' pattern where the understander is the receiver (marked with -ს). The verb მესმის is the anchor for this scene and is used for both physically hearing a sound and mentally understanding an idea."
"perception_seeing_present","stage_active_present_03","The Seeing Scene","[Subject] + [Object]-ს + [Verb]","Used for physically seeing someone or something, or watching a process.","Just like making or building, seeing someone else is an 'active' process in the present. The person seeing is in their base form, and the person or thing seen gets the -ს ending to show they are the object. Georgian verbs often hide a secret marker (like ვ- for 'I' or გ- for 'you') inside the verb to show who is involved."
"discovery_finding_present","stage_active_present_03","The Search and Discovery Scene","[Subject] + [Object]-ს + [Verb]","Used for looking for something lost or finding a solution.","Searching and finding are 'target-oriented' actions. The subject is in the base form and the object takes the -ს ending. In Georgian, finding and searching are closely related in logic—you are performing an action on an external object to change its status. This is a standard action frame where a person acts on an external thing."
"objective_version_present","stage_active_present_03","The Service Scene (For Someone)","[Subject] + [Recipient]-ს + [Object]-ს + [Verb]","Used when you do an action FOR another person (e.g., I'm making coffee for you).","This is a unique Georgian power. By putting a specific vowel (usually -უ- or -ი-) inside the verb, you signal that the action is being done for someone else's benefit. We call this the **Objective Version**. In this frame, both the receiver of the favor and the object itself take the -ს ending. The verb acts as a bridge connecting all participants."
"communication_interaction_present","stage_active_present_03","The Conversation Scene","[Subject] + [Recipient]-ს + [Verb]","Used for two-way interactions like speaking to someone or asking a question.","In Georgian, speaking to someone or asking them a question is seen as an interaction between two people. Because you are directing your words 'at' someone, that person gets the -ს ending. The verb itself often changes its prefix to reflect who is being spoken to (e.g., გ- for you). This is a specialized version of directing an action at a person."
"commerce_transaction_present","stage_active_present_03","The Shopping Scene","[Subject] + [Object]-ს + [Verb]","Used for the act of buying, paying, or costing.","Commerce is a fundamental human transaction. In the present tense, the buyer is the base form and the item or the money being paid takes the -ს ending. This frame is essential for daily life. It follows the standard action logic where the person buying is the center, and the item or price takes the object ending."
"process_start_finish","stage_active_present_03","The Process Scene","[Subject] + [Task]-ს + [Verb]","Used for actions that describe beginning or ending a task (e.g., I'm starting work).","When you describe the progress of a task, the grammar follows the standard action logic. The person starting or finishing is in the simplest base form (**Nominative Case**), and the task being started or finished takes the -ს ending. Verbs in this frame, like ვიწყებ (start) and ვამთავრებ (finish), help you describe your timeline and current focus."
"taking_getting","stage_active_present_03","The Manual Action Scene","[Subject] + [Object]-ს + [Verb]","Used for manual actions like taking an object, getting a ticket, or receiving something.","This frame is for physical interactions where you take or receive an item. The person taking is in the base form, and the item being taken gets the -ს ending. The verb used here, ვიღებ, is very versatile in Georgian; it is used for taking a shower, taking a photo, or getting a sip of a drink. It describes a person bringing an object into their possession or experience."
"selection_order","stage_active_present_03","The Selection Scene","[Subject] + [Object]-ს + [Verb]","Used for choosing an option or ordering food and drinks at a restaurant.","Choosing and ordering are social actions where you select one thing from many. The grammar is consistent with other action frames: you are the base form, and the item you choose or order takes the -ს ending. The verbs ვუკვეთავ (order) and ვირჩევ (choose) are the anchors here. They show the direct path between your decision and the resulting choice."
"expectation_waiting","stage_active_present_03","The Expectation Scene","[Subject] + [Person/Thing]-ს + [Verb]","Used for waiting for someone or something to arrive.","Waiting is treated as an action directed 'toward' a target. In Georgian, the person or thing you are waiting for gets the -ს ending. The verb ველოდები (wait) is special because it often uses internal markers (like გ- for 'you') to show exactly who you are waiting for. The person doing the waiting remains in their simplest base form."
"frequency_habit","stage_active_present_03","The Temporal Scene","[Subject] + [Frequency] + [Verb]","Used to describe how often you perform an activity (always, often, rarely).","This frame teaches you how to add time-based descriptions to your actions. In Georgian, words for frequency (like ყოველდღე for 'every day' or ხშირად for 'often') usually sit right before the verb. The grammar of the sentence is determined by the specific verb you use, but this frame focuses on the 'habitual' nature of the action. It allows you to move from describing one-time events to describing your lifestyle."
"obligation_must","stage_intent_07","The Obligation Scene","[Subject] + [Verb] + უნდა","Used to express 'must,' 'should,' or 'have to.'","The grammar depends on the verb type. If the verb is **Intransitive** (e.g., going), the subject stays in the base form (**Nominative**). If the verb is **Transitive** (doing something to an object), the subject takes the **Ergative Case** (-მა). The main verb takes the Optative ending."
"emotion_states","stage_experiencer_02","The Emotion Scene","[Person]-ს + [Verb]","Used for internal feelings like joy, fear, or surprise.","In the Georgian worldview, emotions are things that 'happen to you' rather than things you 'do.' Because of this, the person feeling the emotion is the receiver and gets the -ს ending (the **Dative Case**). The logic is 'Fear is to me' (მეშინია) or 'Joy is to me' (მიხარია). This is a very common pattern for any verb describing an internal state or feeling."
"plans_intent","stage_active_present_03","The Intent Scene","[Subject] + [Action]-ს + ვაპირებ","Used to say 'I plan to...' or 'I intend to...'","When you describe a future plan, the action you are planning is treated as the object of the sentence. The person planning is in their simplest base form, and the action being planned (like 'going' or 'studying') takes the -ს ending. The verb ვაპირებ acts as the anchor, showing your mental commitment to an upcoming activity."
"irregular_future_motion","stage_motion_04","The Future Motion Scene","[Subject/Nom] + [Goal]-ში + წავალ","Used specifically for saying 'I will go' or 'He will go' in the future.","The verb for 'going' changes its root from -di- to -val- in the future. Because this is a motion verb (Intransitive), the traveler remains in the simple **Nominative Case** (base form), unlike transitive future verbs which might require Ergative."
"active_future","stage_future_04","The Future Scene","[Subject] + [Object]-ს + [Preverb]-[Verb]","Used to say you WILL do something.","In Georgian, the Future is just the Present tense + a Prefix (Preverb). For example, 'V-cer' (I write) becomes 'Da-v-cer' (I will write). Grammar rules are identical to the Present tense."
"active_imperfect","stage_narrative_06","The Background Scene","[Subject] + [Object]-ს + [Verb]-დი","Used to say 'I was doing' or 'I used to do'.","This describes an action in the past that was ongoing or repeated. The Subject stays Plain (Nominative) and the Object keeps the -ს (Dative). You usually just add '-di' to the present tense verb."
"active_past_aorist","stage_narrative_06","The Storytelling Scene","[Subject]-მა + [Object] + [Verb]","Used for completed actions in the past.","This is the famous 'Ergative' split. When an action is finished, the Subject takes the **-მა** ending. The Object becomes plain (Nominative). The -ს marker disappears."
"logic_reason","stage_logic_10","The Reason Scene","[Frame A] + Connector + [Frame B]","Used to link two thoughts together using 'because' or 'therefore.'","This frame focuses on building complex sentences. To explain 'why' something is happening, you use connectors like იმიტომ რომ (because) or ამიტომ (therefore). These words act as a bridge between two independent frames. Learning these connectors allows you to move from simple snapshots of information to logical explanations and arguments."
"physical_sensations","stage_experiencer_02","The Physical State Scene","[Person]-ს + [Verb]","Used for biological needs like hunger, thirst, or feeling cold/hot.","In Georgian, physical sensations like hunger or cold are treated like 'feelings' that happen to you. You are the receiver of the sensation, so your name or the pronoun gets the -ს ending. In grammar, we call this the **Dative Case**. For example, to say 'I am hungry,' the logic is 'Hunger is to me' (მშია). This is another example of **Inversion**, where the person who is the center of the sentence is grammatically the receiver, not the 'doer'."
"ownership_belonging","stage_experiencer_02","The Belonging Scene","[Thing] + [Person]-ს + ეკუთვნის","Used to say that something belongs to a specific person.","This frame describes ownership from the perspective of the object. Instead of 'I own this,' the logic is 'This belongs to me.' The object being owned is in its simplest base form (**Nominative Case**), and the person it belongs to gets the -ს ending. This is because the person is the receiver of the 'belonging.' The verb ეკუთვნის anchors this relationship, acting as a bridge between the item and the owner."
"discovery_loss_active","stage_active_present_03","The Find and Lose Scene","[Subject] + [Object]-ს + [Verb]","Used for finding something you were looking for or accidentally losing an object.","Finding and losing are treated as active processes where you interact with an object. The person doing the finding or losing is in their simplest base form (**Nominative Case**), and the item being found or lost takes the -ს ending. This frame is essential for daily life and uses the standard action logic where the 'actor' is the base and the 'target' takes the object marker."
"becoming_change_state","stage_active_present_03","The Becoming Scene","[Subject] + [Verb]","Used for processes where you are changing state, such as getting tired or getting ready.","These verbs describe a process that is happening to the subject over time. Unlike a simple state (like 'I am tired'), these verbs describe the 'getting' or 'becoming' (e.g., 'I am getting tired'). The person undergoing the change is in their simplest base form (**Nominative Case**). These verbs often have a reflexive feel, as the action is contained within the person themselves. Common examples include ვიღლები (I am getting tired) and ვემზადები (I am getting ready)."
"permission_possibility","stage_intent_07","The Permission Scene","შეიძლება + [Verb]","Used for asking 'May I?' or 'Can I?' in a polite and social way.","This is one of the most useful 'polite' frames in Georgian. It uses the word შეიძლება, which means 'it is possible' or 'it is allowed.' When you add an action verb after it, it creates a request (e.g., 'May I enter?'). The verb following 'it is possible' usually takes a special 'request' ending known as the **Optative Mood**. Because this frame is impersonal (it doesn't focus on a specific 'I' or 'You' acting), it is a safe and polite way to navigate social situations."
"reported_speech","stage_logic_10","The Reporting Scene","[Subject] + [Verb] + რომ + [Frame]","Used to say 'He said that...' or 'I know that...' to link two thoughts.","To link a verb of saying or thinking to another sentence, Georgian uses the connector რომ, which acts like the English word 'that.' The first part of the sentence identifies the speaker or thinker, and the second part contains the information being reported. This is the foundation for complex storytelling and sharing information from others."
"evidential_perfect","stage_experience_09","The Result Scene","[Person]-ს + [Verb]","Used when you didn't see an action happen, but you see the result (Apparently...).","This is a fascinating Georgian frame used for 'unwitnessed' actions. If you wake up and see snow on the ground, you don't say 'It snowed' (Aorist); you say 'Apparently, it has snowed.' This uses the **Inversion** pattern where the person or thing is the receiver (marked with -ს). In grammar, this is the **Perfect** tense. It focuses on the current result of a past event rather than the action itself."
"comparison_degree","stage_logic_10","The Comparison Scene","[X] + [Y]-ზე + [Adj]","Used to say that one thing is 'more' or 'better' than another.","In Georgian, to say 'than,' you use the same -ზე ending that normally means 'on.' When you attach -ზე to the second thing you are comparing, it creates the comparison logic (e.g., 'A is bigger than B' becomes 'A is B-on big'). The things being compared are in their simplest base form. This is a very efficient way to express degree and preference."
"purpose_intent","stage_intent_07","The Purpose Scene","[Frame A] + იმისთვის, რომ + [Frame B]","Used to explain 'why' you are doing something (In order to...).","This frame links an action to its goal. It uses the complex connector იმისთვის, რომ, which means 'for the purpose that' or 'in order to.' The action in the second part of the sentence usually takes the 'request' ending (**Optative Mood**) because it represents a goal or a desired outcome rather than a finished fact."
"conditional_present","stage_logic_10","The 'Would' Scene","[Subject] + [Object]-ს + [Preverb]-[Verb]-დი","Used to say 'I would do it'.","This is technically the Future Tense + the Past ending. It describes what would happen if a condition were met. Subject is Plain, Object has -ს."
"conditionals_real","stage_logic_10","The 'If' Scene","თუ + [Present], მაშინ + [Result]","Used for 'If/Then' logic (e.g., If it rains, I will stay).","To express a condition, you start the sentence with თუ (if). The second part of the sentence, the result, often starts with მაშინ (then). The grammar of each part follows the standard rules for the specific verbs used. This frame is essential for planning, negotiating, and discussing possibilities."
"version_shift_benefactive","stage_social_08","The Past Service Scene","[Subject]-მა + [Recipient]-ს + [Object] + [Verb]","Used to say 'I did/bought X for you' in the past tense.","This combines the 'Completed Action' grammar with the 'Service' marker. Because the action is finished, the person doing it gets the heavy -მა ending. However, because you did it 'for someone,' the receiver still gets the -ს ending. A special marker (like -გი- or -მი-) is tucked inside the verb to point to the receiver. This frame is the peak of Georgian 'polypersonal' grammar, where the verb tracks everyone involved."
"motion_advanced_directional","stage_motion_04","The Vertical/Back Motion Scene","[Subject] + [Goal]-ში + [Verb]","Used for specific directions like going up, going down, or returning back.","Georgian preverbs act as a 'Spatial GPS.' While მი- is away and მო- is toward, other prefixes define the path: ა- (up), ჩა- (down), and და- (back/about). By changing just the first letter of a motion verb, you change the entire scene. The traveler is in the base form and the destination takes a marker like -ში (in) or -ზე (on)."
"success_managing","stage_active_present_03","The Achievement Scene","[Subject] + [Action] + მოახერხა","Used to say you 'managed to' or 'succeeded in' doing something.","This frame focuses on the outcome of an effort. While 'can' describes ability, the verb მოახერხა (managed) describes the successful completion of a difficult task. The person who managed the task is in the base form in the present, or the heavy -მა form in the past. This is a very common way to describe overcoming a challenge."
"passive_state_result","stage_foundations_01","The Passive Scene","[Noun] + [Participle] + არის","Used to describe a state resulting from an action (e.g., The door is closed).","Instead of focusing on who did an action, this frame focuses on the current state of an object. It uses a 'Participle' (a verb turned into an adjective), which usually ends in -ული or -ილი. For example, 'The shop is closed' or 'The dinner is made.' The object is in the simplest base form (**Nominative Case**), and we use the standard 'is' (არის) to describe its state."
"general_relative_finale","stage_logic_10","The 'Whatever' Scene","რაც არ უნდა + [Verb]","Used for expressions like 'no matter what' or 'whatever happens.'","This is a high-level logical frame used to show that a result will happen regardless of circumstances. The phrase რაც არ უნდა means 'whatever it may be.' It is often used with 'must' or 'should' logic to show determination or inevitability. This is the 'Master Key' for expressing resilience and non-negotiable facts in conversation."
"relative_clause_identity","stage_logic_10","The 'Who/Which' Scene","ის, ვინც / ის, რაც + [Verb]","Used to describe a person or thing using a sentence (The one who...).","Georgian uses a 'mirror' structure. You point to the object (**ის**) and then link it with **ვინც** (who) or **რაც** (which/that). Example: 'Is kaci, vinc cers' (That man, who writes)."
"reflexive_action","stage_foundations_01","The 'Self' Scene","[Subject] + საკუთარ თავს + [Verb]","Used to say 'Myself', 'Yourself', 'Himself'.","Georgian doesn't have a word like 'self'. Instead, it uses the word **თავი** (Head). To say 'I see myself', you literally say 'I see my head' (Chems tavs vxedav)."
"dynamic_passive","stage_active_present_03","The 'Happening' Scene","[Subject] + [Verb]","Used when an action happens to something (It opens, It breaks).","Unlike 'Active' verbs (I open the door), these verbs describe the object changing on its own. The Subject is plain (Nominative). The verb often has an **-ება** ending (e.g., 'Igeba' - It opens)."
"temporal_sequence_after","stage_logic_10","The 'After' Scene","[Noun]-ის შემდეგ / მერე","Used to say 'After X' (After work, After dinner).","Uses the postposition **-ის შემდეგ** or **-ის მერე**. Because these are postpositions, the noun takes the Genitive Case (ending in -is)."
